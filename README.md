# Social Network

## User Story

As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database, so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Description

This is a development for the server side utilizing NoSQL to build a database of users, their thoughts (posts), and reactions to posts. Users can add each other as friends as well. This back end handles adding/deleting/updating users, adding/deleting thoughts, and adding/deleting reactions to thoughts. 

## Acceptance Criteria

- [] When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- [] When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- [] When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- [] When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Expected Outcome

Utilizing Insomnia to test routes, user is able to create users, update users, and delete users.
Utilizing Insomnia to test routes, user is able to add and remove friends.
